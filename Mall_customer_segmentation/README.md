# Customer Segmentation
  
## Overview:
    Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of any business, as it helps to identify and target specific groups of customers. The goal of this project is to perform customer segmentation of mall customers using two popular clustering algorithms, K-Means and hierarchical clustering. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, which contains features such as CustomerID, Genre, Age, Annual Income (k$), and Spending Score (1-100).

	In this project, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset and selected the relevant features for clustering. We then applied K-Means clustering and determined the optimal number of clusters using silhouette score and the Elbow method. We plotted the results of the clustering to visually analyze the clusters.

	In addition to K-Means, we also applied hierarchical clustering on the dataset and plotted the dendrogram to determine the optimal number of clusters. We then plotted the results of the hierarchical clustering to visually analyze the clusters.

	The end goal of this project is to identify specific customer groups based on their spending behavior and demographics. This will enable mall shop owners to focus on these groups and tailor their marketing and sales strategies accordingly.
