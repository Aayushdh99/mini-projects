# Churn prediction
  
## Overview:
The objective of this project is to analyze employee churn and predict which employees are likely to leave the company. The dataset used for this project is from Kaggle, and it includes features such as employee satisfaction, performance evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours worked, time spent at the company, work accident history, promotions received in the last 5 years, department, salary, and whether or not the employee left the company.

To achieve the project goal, we performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset and identified patterns and trends in the data. We also visualized the data using various graphs and plots. Based on the insights from the EDA, we selected the most relevant features for the churn prediction task.

To build the churn prediction model, we trained six different machine learning models - logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting (GB) classifier, and XGBoost classifier. We also performed preprocessing steps such as one-hot encoding of categorical variables and scaling of numerical variables.

In addition to training the models, we also evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also performed cross-validation to ensure that the models generalize well to unseen data.

The final model selected for the churn prediction task is the one with the highest performance on the evaluation metrics. The model can be used to predict which employees are likely to leave the company, and the insights obtained from the model can help the company take proactive measures to retain its valuable employees.
